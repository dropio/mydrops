myDrops is a small web app to keep track of your Drops.
To learn what a drop is, visit http://drop.io

myDrops uses Drop.io's API (Application Programming Interface) alongside
PHP, Javascript, and AJAX to manage Drops.
Existing Drops can be added to one's myDrops account or created from scratch,
as well as remove and destroyed via Drop.io's API.

In order to install myDrops, you must have these installed:
1) PHP version 5 or greater
2) A MySQL database server

First, create a SQL database named "dropmanager". Then, simply place the files
in the correct server directory and execute "dropschema.sql" into your MySQL database.
After that, copy config.php.default to config.php and edit it with your Drop.io API key and
login details for your SQL database.

The site should then be fully functional!
